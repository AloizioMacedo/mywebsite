                        An intricate MILP optimization model for optimizing
                        traffic light offsets relative to each other to create
                        optimized green waves across traffic grids, which is
                        based on an interpretation of a cycle-consistent
                        attribution of the offsets based on the vanishing of an
                        integral 1-form on the cycles of the grid.

                This included different optimization algorithms such as Ant
                Colony Optimization and simulated annealing for probabilistic
                and heuristic approaches as well as MILP formulations and some
                greedy approaches. The problems were further complications of
                the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem,
                including constraints such as jobs dependencies, different job
                durations, availability windows etc. The Ant Colony Optimization
                was particularly involved and was further improved by a custom
                low-level implementation of the logic, speeding up the runtime
                by around 40 times compared to a naive implementation in Python.
