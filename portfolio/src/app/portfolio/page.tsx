                Across different sectors of the industry, such as{" "}
                <strong>call centers</strong> and <strong>back-offices</strong>,
                there is a lot of opportunity around correctly allocating people
                to handle incoming demand.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The general process for scheduling optimization that I was
                involved with consisted of three major steps:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.schedulingList}>
                <li>
                    <strong>Demand Forecasting</strong>: In order to effectively
                    prepare for the demand of upcoming weeks, it is necessary to
                    have a reasonable expectation of how the demand profile will
                    be. By using a concoction of forecasting tools (such as{" "}
                    <strong>Prophet</strong>, <strong>TBATS</strong> etc) and
                    given that the seasonal behavior of demand is usually rather
                    stable in those business segments, we were able to prepare
                    ahead with a remarkable accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Schedules Generation</strong>: Given alignment with
                    the business, we established constraints for the possible
                    schedules that can be assigned headcount by our optimization
                    process. Those constraints include things such as start
                    times, shift lengths, break times, etc. Then, we need to
                    generate the entire combinatoric result of those
                    constraints, making sure they are self-consistent, and
                    generate the possible schedules that can be fed into the
                    optimizer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Headcount Optimization</strong>: After setting those
                    basic inputs (the <strong>demand</strong> and the
                    constraints on the <strong>supply</strong>), we proceed to
                    the optimization step to obtain the headcounts, which
                    consists of a{" "}
                    <strong>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</strong> step that
                    can incorporate several parameters such as SLA (Service
                    Level Agreements), headcount constraints, demand smoothing
                    etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the process allows us to shuffle and rescale
                headcount for different roles and job types ensuring optimized
                allocation of resources.
            </p>

                <strong>MILP formulations</strong> and some greedy approaches.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The Ant Colony Optimization implementation was particularly
                involved due to the need of several time-specific and coupled
                constraints, and was further improved by a custom low-level
                implementation of the logic, speeding up the runtime by around
                40 times compared to a naive implementation in Python.
