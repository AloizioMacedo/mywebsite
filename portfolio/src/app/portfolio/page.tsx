                and heuristic approaches as well as MILP formulations and some
                greedy approaches. The problems were further complications of

                including constraints such as jobs dependencies, different job
                durations, availability windows etc. The Ant Colony Optimization
                was particularly involved and was further improved by a custom
                low-level implementation of the logic, speeding up the runtime
                by around 40 times compared to a naive implementation in Python.
